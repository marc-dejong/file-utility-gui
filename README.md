## üÜï What's New in Release 2025-08-28-a

### Option 9 ‚Äî Split by Key (Match / No Match)
**Modules:** `key_split_9x.py`, `key_split_ui_9x_gui.py`

- Builds a key set from a **KEY file**, then streams the **MAIN file** once.
- Writes each row to **MATCHED** or **NONMATCHED** outputs.  
- Normalization options: case-insensitive, whitespace-strip, auto zero-pad widths from KEY.  
- Encoding probe with UTF-8 fallback to cp1252.  
- Outputs:  
  - `<main>_MATCHED.csv`  
  - `<main>_NONMATCHED.csv`  
  - `<main>_SPLIT_COUNTS.txt` (summary report)

**Performance Notes:**  
- MAIN is streamed in a single pass; memory use scales with KEY size.  
- Ideal for very large MAIN with smaller KEY.

## üß© Routing & UX Updates

- Fast-path auto-launch for functions #11 and #12.  
- Option 9 fully integrated into controller.  
- Improved label rendering and delimiter auto-detection.  
- Window centering and UI clamping for consistent display.

## üíª How to Run

Ensure all scripts are in the same folder, then launch the main GUI:
```bash
python file_util_gui_0x.py
```

### Quick Start (Option 9 Example)
1. Select **Main file** and **Key file**.  
2. Click **Preview headers**.  
3. Select matching fields on each side and **Add Pair**.  
4. (Optional) Override output filenames.  
5. Click **Run Now** to process.  

A summary dialog appears; totals are also saved to the `_SPLIT_COUNTS.txt` file.

| `file_util_gui_0x.py` | Main controller (routing + fast-paths) |
| `key_split_9x.py` | Engine for Option 9 (streamed split by key) |
| `key_split_ui_9x_gui.py` | GUI for Option 9 (mapping, options, run) |
| `merger_gui_10x.py` | Merge GUI / engine |
